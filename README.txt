The app that I have created is an app that gives a basic rundown of Dungeons and Dragons. The app is made using tabbed pages and the information is gathered from the D&D API.

The home tab contains my own decriptions of a basic decription of what D&D is, the uses of dice within the game and what a character sheet is.

The spell tab shows all of the available spells in the base version of D&D. It uses two-way data binding and is displayed as a list.

The monsters tab displays the offical monsters that can be used in the game. It uses two-way data binding and is displayed as a list. It also has descriptions of different shape/forms that monsters can be seen as.

The classes tab uses two-way data binding to show all the classes in a list. Below the list I have added descriptions of each class and what each class briefly revolves around within the game.
